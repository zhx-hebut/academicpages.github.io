**Abstract:** Matrix factorization has now become a dominant solution for
personalized recommendation on the Social Web. To alleviate
the cold start problem, previous approaches have incorporated
various additional sources of information into traditional matrix factorization models. These upgraded models, however,
achieve only “marginal” enhancements on the performance
of personalized recommendation. Therefore, inspired by the
recent development of deep-semantic modeling, we propose
a hybrid deep-semantic matrix factorization (HDMF) model
to further improve the performance of tag-aware personalized recommendation by integrating the techniques of deep-semantic modeling, hybrid learning, and matrix factorization.
Experimental results show that HDMF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in tag-aware personalized
recommendation, in terms of all evaluation metrics.

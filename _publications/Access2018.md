**Abstract:** With the rapid growth of social tagging systems, many research efforts are being put into
personalized search and recommendation using social tags (i.e., folksonomies). As users can freely choose
their own vocabulary, social tags can be very ambiguous (for instance, due to the use of homonyms or synonyms). Machine learning techniques (such as clustering and deep neural networks) are usually applied
to overcome this tag ambiguity problem. However, the machine-learning-based solutions always need very
powerful computing facilities to train recommendation models from a large amount of data, so they are inappropriate to be used in lightweight recommender systems. In this paper, we propose an ontological similarity
to tackle the tag ambiguity problem without the need of model training by using contextual information. The
novelty of this ontological similarity is that it first leverages external domain ontologies to disambiguate
tag information, and then semantically quantifies the relevance between user and item profiles according to
the semantic similarity of the matching concepts of tags in the respective profiles. Our experiments show
that the proposed ontological similarity is semantically more accurate than the state-of-the-art similarity
metrics, and can thus be applied to improve the performance of content-based tag-aware personalized
recommendation on the social web. Consequently, as a model-training-free solution, ontological similarity is
a good disambiguation choice for lightweight recommender systems and a complement to machine-learningbased recommendation solutions.

**Abstract:** With the popularity of mobile devices and the quick growth
of the mobile Web, users can now browse news wherever they want, so
their news preferences are usually strongly correlated with their geographical contexts. Consequently, many research efforts have been put
on location-aware news recommendation; the explored approaches can
mainly be divided into physical distance-based and geographical topicbased ones. As for geographical topic-based location-aware news recommendation, ELSA is the state-of-the-art geographical topic model: it
has been reported to outperform many other topic models, e.g., BOW,
LDA, and ESA. However, the Wikipedia-based topic space in ELSA
suffers from the problems of high dimensionality, sparsity, and redundancy, which greatly degrade the recommendation performance of ELSA.
Therefore, to overcome these problems, in this work, we propose three
novel geographical topic feature models, CLSA, ALSA, and DLSA, which
integrate clustering, autoencoders, and recommendation-oriented deep
neural networks, respectively, with ELSA to extract dense, abstract, low
dimensional, and effective topic features from the Wikipedia-based topic
space for the representation of news and locations. Experimental results
show that (i) CLSA, ALSA, and DLSA all greatly outperform the stateof-the-art geographical topic model, ELSA, in location-aware news recommendation in terms of both the recommendation effectiveness and
efficiency; (ii) Deep Localized Semantic Analysis (DLSA) achieves the
most significant improvements: its precision, recall, MRR, and MAP are
all about 3 times better than those of ELSA; while its recommendation
time-cost is only about 1/29 of that of ELSA; and (iii) DLSA, ALSA,
and CLSA can also remedy the “cold-start” problem by uncovering users’
latent news preferences at new locations.

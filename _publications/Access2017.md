**Abstract:** With the popularity of mobile devices and the quick growth of the mobile Web, users can
now browse news wherever they want; so, their news preferences are usually related to their geographical
contexts. Consequently, many research efforts have been put on location-aware news recommendation,
which recommends to users news happening nearest to them. Nevertheless, in a real-world context,
users’ news preferences are not only related to their locations, but also strongly related to their personal
interests. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hybrid method called location-aware personalized news
recommendation with explicit semantic analysis (LP-ESA), which recommends news using both the users’
personal interests and their geographical contexts. However, the Wikipedia-based topic space in LP-ESA
suffers from the problems of high dimensionality, sparsity, and redundancy, which greatly degrade the
performance of LP-ESA. To address these problems, we further propose a novel method called LP-DSA
to exploit recommendation-oriented deep neural networks to extract dense, abstract, low dimensional, and
effective feature representations for users, news, and locations. Experimental results show that LP-ESA
and LP-DSA both significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, LP-DSA offers more
effective (19.8%–179.6% better) online news recommendation with much lower time cost (25 times quicker)
than LP-ESA.

**Abstract:** Recently, many efforts have been put into tag-aware
personalized recommendation. However, due to uncontrolled vocabularies, social tags are usually redundant, sparse, and ambiguous. In this paper, we
propose a deep neural network approach to solve
this problem by mapping the tag-based user and
item profiles to an abstract deep feature space,
where the deep-semantic similarities between users
and their target items (resp., irrelevant items) are
maximized (resp., minimized). To ensure the scalability in practice, we further propose to improve
this model’s training efficiency by using hybrid
deep learning and negative sampling. Experimental results show that our approach can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines in
tag-aware personalized recommendation (3.8 times
better than the best baseline), and that using hybrid
deep learning and negative sampling can dramatically enhance the model’s training efficiency (hundreds of times quicker), while maintaining similar
(and sometimes even better) training quality and
recommendation performance.

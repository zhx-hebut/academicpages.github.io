**Authors:** Jianzhong Qi, **Zhenghua Xu**, Yuan Xue and Zeyi Wen.  
**Abstract:** Given a set of clients and a set of existing facilities, the
min-dist location selection query returns a location from a
given set of potential locations for establishing a new facility so that the average distance between a client and her
nearest facility is minimized. This type of queries has a
wide range of applications in marketing, decision support
systems, urban development simulations and massively
multiplayer online games. The computational cost of a
naive algorithm, which sequentially scans all the potential
locations, is too high to process this type of queries in real
time. Motivated by this, we propose a branch and bound
algorithm that exploits geometric properties of the data
objects and early prunes unpromising potential locations
from consideration to achieve a higher query processing
efficiency. We conduct a detailed cost analysis and extensive experiments to validate the efficiency of the branch
and bound algorithm. The results show that the proposed
algorithm outperforms the naive algorithm constantly.

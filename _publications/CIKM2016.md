**Abstract:** With the rapid growth of social tagging systems, many efforts have been put on tag-aware personalized recommendation. However, due to uncontrolled vocabularies, social
tags are usually redundant, sparse, and ambiguous. In this
paper, we propose a deep neural network approach to solve
this problem by mapping both the tag-based user and item
profiles to an abstract deep feature space, where the deepsemantic similarities between users and their target items
(resp., irrelevant items) are maximized (resp., minimized).
Due to huge numbers of online items, the training of this
model is usually computationally expensive in the real-world
context. Therefore, we introduce negative sampling, which
significantly increases the model’s training efficiency (109.6
times quicker) and ensures the scalability in practice. Experimental results show that our model can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines in tag-aware personalized
recommendation: e.g., its mean reciprocal rank is between
5.7 and 16.5 times better than the baselines.
